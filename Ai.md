## Major Task: Checkstyle Compliance Fix

**Problem**: 79+ checkstyle violations across 19 Java files preventing clean builds

**Solution**: Claude systematically fixed all violations by:
- Adding missing Javadoc documentation for classes, methods, and constructors
- Fixing import order issues (Java imports → external libraries → static imports)
- Splitting long lines (206+ characters → under 120 character limit)
- Correcting visibility modifiers and spacing issues
- Cleaning up test files and removing commented code

**Results**:
- **Main Classes**: ✅ 100% compliant (0 errors, BUILD SUCCESSFUL)
- **Test Classes**: ~95% improved (from 60 to 12 minor issues)
- **Overall**: 85% error reduction

## Key Files Fixed
- Event.java, Deadline.java, ToDo.java - Added Javadoc, split long lines
- Storage.java - Fixed inner class documentation and visibility
- All message package classes - Added comprehensive documentation
- Test classes - Import order, spacing, documentation improvements

## Time Savings
**Manual effort estimate**: 2-3 hours
**AI-assisted time**: 30-40 mins

## What Worked Well
- Systematic file-by-file approach prevented missing issues
- Real-time checkstyle verification after each fix
- AI provided meaningful documentation, not just boilerplate
- Efficient bulk editing for similar patterns across files

## What didn't work well
- Some errors were missed by the AI, which meant that I had to manually change.
- AI changed some fields from public to private but didn't change classes using those fields

## Overall Assessment
Highly effective for code quality tasks. Transformed tedious manual work into efficient systematic process. Codebase now much more maintainable with proper documentation and consistent formatting.
